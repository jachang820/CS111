#CS111 Projects#

##Disclaimer to UCLA Students##

Note that this is for the purposes of showcasing programming for resume purposes or discussing with friends not from UCLA. If you go to UCLA, please attempt the projects on your own, or copy at your own risk. CS111 gets you used to looking up obscure library calls and API. Looking up solutions online might help further your understanding of the specifications, but copying prevents you from learning anything. Trust me -- if you walk away with 0 systems knowledge whatsoever, getting used to reading library APIs will make you more efficient in whatever you want to pursue. In that sense, CS111 with Prof. Reiher was one of the best CS classes in the UCLA curriculum.
