Files included:
README - This file, a brief description.
lab0.c - Source file for copying stdin to stdout with read(2) and write(2)
       	 Usage: /lab0 --input=filename --output=filename --segfault --catch
	 --input     : Input file redirection
	 --output    : Output file redirection
	 --segfault  : Forces a segmentation fault
	 --catch     : Catches segmentation fault by using a new handler
	 	       with signal(2)
Makefile -
	 Make options:
	 (default)   : Builds executable with -g for debugging
	 check       : Performs a series of checks to test for correctness
	 dist        : Compresses files into .tgz gzip tar
	 clean	     : Deletes all files created by the Makefile
backtrace.png  - Screenshot of stack backtrace at the segmentation fault
breakpoint.png - Screenshot of break before the fault and the null pointer

Smoke-test cases:
1. Error free build
2. Error free build with --catch option
Exit code and existence of stderr for:
3. --segfault
4. --segfault --catch
5. Invalid option
6. Invalid argument
7. --input=nonexistent_file
8. --output (permission denied)
9.  stdin --> stdout
10. input --> stdout
11. stdin --> output
12. input --> output

Resources used: Besides the specified man files, project description page, and
 smoke-test bash script, the following online resources were used:

https://linux.die.net/man/2/lseek
lseek(2) was suggested on the man page for write(2) as means to figure out the
size of the buffer.

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Contents.html
The general purpose manual for Makefiles was useful to discover some syntax
issues.

https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Echoing.html
Silencing recipe echo with .SILENT: was especially helpful in cleaning up the
output from make check.

This page explains how to escape the shell variable $? and also has a brief
explanation for why it is necessary to string every line with continuation
character \
