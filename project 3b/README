README		- This file, a brief description.

Makefile	- Make options:
		  (default)
		  build		: Creates script for running lab3b.
		  dist		: Creates distribution tar.
		  clean		: Removes all output by Makefile.

lab3b.rb	- Source file for image report analyzer. It's written in
		  Ruby 2.0.0, supported on lnxsrv09. The language was chosen
		  for its flexibility in object handling (all types are
		  objects), regular expressions, and first-class functions
		  that make it easy to manipulate text.
		  Usage: ./lab3b csv_file

This answer post tells how to include and use a multi-line string in a
Makefile. This makes it easier to generate a script file to run a Ruby script
without the .rb extension. It might have been possible to install a Ruby gem,
an extension to package the script, link Ruby libraries, to create an 
executable, but this might run into privilege issues with sudo. A bash script
seems like it should work for the task.
