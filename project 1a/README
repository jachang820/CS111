Note: I tried various settings for tcsetattr(3) and could not get non-
      canonical mode to work exactly as expected. No matter what, the
      erase character is still recognized by the terminal, but the
      shell will not recognize it sometimes. This turned out to be due
      to that write(2)ing the erase (ascii 127) character to stdout
      appears as if a character is being deleted, despite that it is
      already output. However, this also causes shell to have
      inconsistent behavior. One solution is to stop passing the erase
      character to shell.

      On the other hand...

      Setting the iflag to ISTRIP seems to have the same effect as setting
      the lflag to ~(ICANON|ECHO), except the latter exits immediately with
      the CTRL+C interrupt signal. To fix, the iflag can be set with IGNBRK.
      However, short of using raw mode cfmakeraw(), this behavior continues
      to obfuscate what non-canonical mode should be.

Slip day (1): My laptop refused to POST this weekend. I drove home to fix it,
     	      hoping I would have the necessary screwdriver to take off the
	      bottom plate -- I did not. When all hope was lost, it finally
	      worked at 1AM in the morning. I spent some time trying to
	      figure out whether VPN worked with UCLA even though I'm at home.
	      It did.

	      Sounds unlikely, but it's true. Murphy's Law...
